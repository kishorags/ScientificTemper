# ISRO Scientific Temper Competition — Reference and Sample Questions

## About the Competition

The **Scientific Temper Competition** (also known as the **Test of Scientific Temper**) is conducted by scientists of the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** in Bangalore, India. The competition is aimed at high school students and is designed to evaluate their scientific awareness, reasoning ability, and approach to understanding everyday phenomena through scientific principles.

Scientific temper — a term deeply rooted in Indian constitutional values (Article 51A of the Indian Constitution) — refers to an attitude of logical thinking, questioning, and seeking evidence-based explanations rather than accepting superstition or unverified claims.

### Competition Format

The competition primarily tests:

- **Approach and reasoning ability** regarding day-to-day activities and observations
- **Understanding of basic scientific principles** and their application
- **Operations, logic, and reasoning** for choosing solutions
- **Original ideas and creative thinking** while remaining scientifically accurate
- **Brief, focused answers** that demonstrate clear thought processes

> **Key evaluation note:** Emphasis is given to understanding of basic scientific principles and the approach to solve the problem, rather than just the solution itself. A partially correct answer with excellent reasoning will score higher than a correct answer with no explanation.

## Sample Questions from Scientific Temper Competitions

The following questions are representative of the style and type of questions asked in ISRO Scientific Temper competitions and similar science outreach events conducted by ISRO scientists. These are compiled from publicly available information about ISRO's educational initiatives, including the YUVIKA (Young Scientist Programme) and National Science Day events.

> **Note:** Official question papers from past ISRO Scientific Temper competitions are not widely published online. The questions below are based on publicly available descriptions of the competition format and themes from ISRO outreach programs.

### Category 1: Everyday Scientific Phenomena

These questions test the student's ability to explain common observations using scientific principles.

**Q1. How can humans fly around Earth?**

*Expected approach:* Consider the environment needed for flight, the equipment required, and the scientific principles governing flight (Bernoulli's principle for aircraft, orbital mechanics for spacecraft). A good answer identifies that humans need either atmospheric lift (airfoils, engines) or orbital velocity (~28,000 km/h) to continuously fall around Earth.

**Q2. Why do you feel breathless while running?**

*Expected approach:* Identify the increased energy demand of muscles, the role of cellular respiration (C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP), how the brain detects rising CO₂, and the switch to anaerobic respiration when oxygen supply falls short.

**Q3. Why do we see only one side of the moon always?**

*Expected approach:* Recognize that the moon rotates on its axis with the same period as its orbital period (~27.3 days) — a phenomenon called tidal locking caused by Earth's gravitational forces acting on the moon over billions of years.

**Q4. Why does an iron nail rust but a gold ring does not?**

*Expected approach:* Explain reactivity of metals — iron reacts with oxygen and moisture (oxidation: 4Fe + 3O₂ + 6H₂O → 4Fe(OH)₃) while gold is a noble metal with very low reactivity due to its electron configuration and high ionization energy.

**Q5. Why does a rainbow appear after rain?**

*Expected approach:* Explain dispersion of sunlight through water droplets — white light enters a droplet, refracts, reflects internally, and refracts again on exit. Different wavelengths bend at different angles, separating into the visible spectrum (VIBGYOR).

### Category 2: Space Science and ISRO Missions

These questions test awareness of India's space programme and space science concepts.

**Q6. Why do astronauts float inside a spacecraft orbiting Earth?**

*Expected approach:* Explain that the spacecraft and astronauts are in free fall together — both are falling toward Earth at the same rate while moving forward fast enough to miss it. This creates the sensation of weightlessness (microgravity), not the absence of gravity.

**Q7. How does a satellite stay in orbit without falling down?**

*Expected approach:* A satellite has enough tangential velocity that as it falls toward Earth due to gravity, it keeps moving forward, following a curved path. The gravitational force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion: F = mv²/r = GMm/r².

**Q8. Why is it important to launch rockets near the equator?**

*Expected approach:* The Earth rotates fastest at the equator (~1,670 km/h). Launching eastward from the equator gives the rocket a "free" velocity boost from Earth's rotation, reducing the fuel needed to reach orbital velocity. This is one reason ISRO launches from Sriharikota (close to the equator).

**Q9. What was the scientific objective of Chandrayaan missions?**

*Expected approach:* Chandrayaan-1 (2008) mapped the lunar surface and confirmed the presence of water molecules on the moon. Chandrayaan-3 (2023) achieved a soft landing near the lunar south pole, deployed the Pragyan rover, and studied the lunar surface composition, thermal properties, and seismic activity.

**Q10. Why does a rocket need multiple stages?**

*Expected approach:* As fuel burns, empty fuel tanks become dead weight. By dropping spent stages, the rocket reduces its mass, making the remaining fuel more efficient (Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: Δv = vₑ ln(m₀/mf)). Each stage is optimized for a different phase of the ascent.

### Category 3: Critical Thinking and Scientific Reasoning

These questions test the student's ability to apply the scientific method and distinguish science from superstition.

**Q11. A friend says that full moon nights cause strange behavior in people. How would you respond scientifically?**

*Expected approach:* Discuss confirmation bias (we remember full moon events more), explain that scientific studies have found no statistically significant correlation between full moons and unusual behavior, and emphasize the importance of evidence-based thinking over anecdotal observations.

**Q12. You observe that a metal cup feels colder than a plastic cup at the same room temperature. Why?**

*Expected approach:* Both are at the same temperature, but metal has higher thermal conductivity — it draws heat away from your skin faster than plastic. The sensation of "cold" is actually rapid heat loss from your hand, not a difference in actual temperature.

**Q13. Design a simple experiment to show that hot air rises.**

*Expected approach:* Light a candle and hold a thin strip of tissue paper above it — the paper will flutter upward. Alternatively, observe smoke rising from incense. The scientific explanation involves convection — heated air becomes less dense and rises, displaced by cooler, denser surrounding air.

**Q14. Why do ships made of steel float while a steel ball sinks?**

*Expected approach:* Apply Archimedes' principle — the ship's hull encloses a large volume of air, making the ship's overall density less than water. The weight of water displaced equals the weight of the ship (buoyancy). A solid steel ball has density ~7.8 g/cm³, much greater than water's 1.0 g/cm³.

**Q15. Why does food spoil faster in summer than in winter?**

*Expected approach:* Higher temperature increases the rate of chemical and biological reactions (Arrhenius equation). Bacteria and enzymes responsible for decomposition multiply faster at warmer temperatures, accelerating food spoilage. Refrigeration slows these reactions by lowering temperature.
