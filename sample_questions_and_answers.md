## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating answers, judges emphasize the following (in order of importance):

1. **Understanding of Basic Scientific Principles:** Does the student demonstrate knowledge of fundamental science concepts relevant to the question?
2. **Approach and Reasoning:** Does the student show a logical, step-by-step thought process? How did they arrive at their answer?
3. **Operations and Logic:** Are the reasoning steps clear, and is the logic for choosing a particular solution well explained?
4. **Brevity and Focus:** Are answers concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary information?
5. **Originality:** Does the student offer creative or original ideas while remaining scientifically accurate?

> **Note for students:** Judges care more about *how you think* than *what you know*. A partially correct answer with excellent reasoning will score higher than a correct answer with no explanation of approach.

### How a Good Answer is Structured

For each question, a strong answer should follow this pattern:

1. **Identify the core scientific problem** — What is really being asked?
2. **State the relevant scientific principles** — What laws, concepts, or phenomena apply?
3. **Reason through the solution step-by-step** — How do these principles lead to an answer?
4. **Provide a brief, focused conclusion** — Summarize the answer concisely.

## Question 1: How can humans fly around Earth?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What environment does a human need to fly?* — Humans cannot fly unaided; we need an atmosphere (for aircraft) or space (for spacecraft). Identifying the environment is the first step.
2. *What equipment is required?* — Aircraft (wings + engines) for atmospheric flight, or rockets/spacecraft for orbital flight.
3. *What scientific principles govern flight?* — Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law for aircraft; orbital mechanics and gravity for spacecraft.

**Answer:**
Humans can fly around Earth using aircraft or spacecraft:

- **Aircraft:** Wings shaped as airfoils create a pressure difference (Bernoulli's principle) — lower pressure above, higher below — generating lift to counteract gravity. Engines provide thrust for forward motion.

- **Spacecraft:** To orbit Earth, a spacecraft must reach orbital velocity (~28,000 km/h). At this speed, it continuously falls toward Earth but moves forward fast enough to keep missing it, maintaining a circular path. This is governed by Newton's law of gravitation: F = G(m₁m₂)/r².

**Key Concepts:** Lift, thrust, gravity, orbital velocity, Bernoulli's principle

## Question 2: Why do you feel breathless while running?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What happens in the body during running?* — Muscles work harder and consume more energy.
2. *What is the energy source?* — ATP, produced via cellular respiration that requires oxygen.
3. *Why does breathing change?* — The brain detects rising CO₂ and falling O₂, signaling faster breathing.
4. *Why the breathless feeling?* — When oxygen demand exceeds supply, anaerobic respiration kicks in.

**Answer:**
When you run, muscles need more ATP (energy), produced through cellular respiration: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy.

- **Increased demand:** Your body consumes oxygen faster and produces more CO₂.
- **Brain response:** Detects elevated CO₂ in blood and signals the respiratory system to breathe faster.
- **Breathlessness occurs** when oxygen supply cannot match demand — muscles switch to anaerobic respiration, producing lactic acid and causing fatigue.

**Key Concepts:** Cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, homeostasis

## Question 3: Why do we see only one side of the moon always?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *Is the moon rotating?* — Yes, the moon does rotate on its axis.
2. *Why do we always see the same face?* — The rotation period must equal the orbital period.
3. *What caused this?* — Tidal forces from Earth gradually slowed the moon's rotation over billions of years.

**Answer:**
We always see the same side because the moon's rotation period equals its orbital period (~27.3 days) — a phenomenon called **tidal locking** (synchronous rotation).

- **Cause:** Earth's gravitational pull created tidal bulges on the moon. Over time, interaction between these bulges and Earth's gravity slowed the moon's rotation until it matched its orbit.
- **Result:** The near side always faces Earth; the far side was unseen until Soviet Luna 3 photographed it in 1959.

**Key Concepts:** Tidal locking, gravitational forces, synchronous rotation

## Question 4: Why does ice float on water?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *Why do most solids sink in their liquid form?* — Solids are generally denser than their liquids.
2. *Why is water different?* — Water molecules form a special crystalline structure when frozen.
3. *What property determines floating?* — Density: objects less dense than the surrounding fluid float.

**Answer:**
Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water — an unusual property.

- **Molecular cause:** When water freezes, molecules form a hexagonal crystalline structure with hydrogen bonds that space molecules farther apart, making ice ~9% less dense than liquid water.
- **Density:** Ice ≈ 0.92 g/cm³ vs. Water ≈ 1.00 g/cm³.
- **Significance:** Ice forming on top of lakes insulates the water below, allowing aquatic life to survive winter.

**Key Concepts:** Density, hydrogen bonding, crystalline structure

## Question 5: Why does a straw appear bent in a glass of water?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What is actually happening?* — The straw is straight but appears bent at the water surface.
2. *What changes at the boundary?* — Light transitions from water to air (different media).
3. *What happens when light changes medium?* — It changes speed and bends (refraction).

**Answer:**
This is caused by **refraction** — the bending of light as it passes between media of different densities.

- Light travels slower in water (refractive index ≈ 1.33) than in air (≈ 1.00). At the boundary, it bends according to Snell's Law: n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂).
- Your eyes trace light rays as straight lines, so the displaced rays make the submerged portion appear shifted from its actual position.

**Key Concepts:** Refraction, refractive index, Snell's Law

## Question 6: Why do we feel cooler when we sweat?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What is sweat?* — Mostly water on the skin surface.
2. *What happens to the sweat?* — It evaporates (liquid → gas).
3. *Does evaporation require energy?* — Yes, phase change absorbs heat from the body.

**Answer:**
Sweating cools the body through **evaporative cooling**:

- Evaporating 1 gram of sweat requires ~2,260 joules of heat, drawn from your skin.
- As sweat molecules absorb this thermal energy and escape as vapor, skin temperature drops.
- In humid conditions, evaporation slows because the air is already saturated with water vapor, making sweating less effective.

**Key Concepts:** Evaporative cooling, latent heat of vaporization, thermoregulation

## Question 7: Why does the sky appear blue during the day and red during sunset?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What is sunlight?* — A mix of all visible wavelengths (colors).
2. *What happens when light enters the atmosphere?* — It interacts with gas molecules and scatters.
3. *Why blue during the day, red at sunset?* — Scattering intensity depends on wavelength; shorter wavelengths scatter more.

**Answer:**
Sky colors result from **Rayleigh scattering** — scattering intensity is proportional to 1/λ⁴ (inverse fourth power of wavelength).

- **Daytime blue:** Sunlight travels a short path through the atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter much more than longer ones (red), filling the sky with blue light.
- **Sunset red:** At sunset, light passes through much more atmosphere. Blue light is scattered away entirely, leaving red and orange to reach your eyes.

**Key Concepts:** Rayleigh scattering, wavelength, electromagnetic spectrum

## Question 8: Why do our fingers get wrinkled after staying in water for a long time?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What happens to skin in water?* — Only fingertips and toes wrinkle, not all skin.
2. *Is it purely physical (osmosis)?* — If so, all skin should wrinkle equally. The selective pattern suggests a biological mechanism.
3. *What controls selective body responses?* — The nervous system.

**Answer:**
Finger wrinkling is an **active nervous system response**, not simple osmosis:

- The brain constricts blood vessels in fingertips (vasoconstriction), causing skin to fold into wrinkles. If finger nerves are damaged, wrinkling does not occur — proving it is neurologically controlled.
- **Evolutionary purpose:** Wrinkled fingers improve grip on wet objects — the wrinkles act as channels that divert water away from the contact surface, increasing friction, similar to how tire treads channel water to maintain road grip.

**Key Concepts:** Nervous system response, vasoconstriction, evolutionary adaptation

## Question 9: Why does a ball thrown upward come back down?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What force acts on the ball?* — Gravity, pulling it toward Earth's center.
2. *What happens to the ball's energy?* — Kinetic energy converts to potential energy on the way up, and back to kinetic on the way down.
3. *When does it stop rising?* — When all kinetic energy is converted to potential energy (velocity = 0), but gravity continues acting.

**Answer:**
The ball returns due to Earth's **gravitational force**, described by Newton's law: F = G(m₁m₂)/r².

- **Going up:** Gravity decelerates the ball, converting kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy.
- **At the peak:** Velocity momentarily reaches zero, but gravitational force persists.
- **Coming down:** Gravity accelerates it at ~9.8 m/s², converting potential energy back to kinetic energy.

**Key Concepts:** Gravity, Newton's laws, conservation of energy

## Question 10: Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *Are lightning and thunder produced at the same time?* — Yes, both originate from the same electrical discharge.
2. *Why the delay?* — Light and sound travel at vastly different speeds.
3. *Can we use this?* — The time gap lets us estimate distance to the storm.

**Answer:**
Light travels at ~3 × 10⁸ m/s, while sound travels at ~343 m/s — about 880,000 times slower.

- Both lightning (visible light) and thunder (sound from rapid air expansion) are produced simultaneously during an electrical discharge.
- Light reaches your eyes almost instantly; sound takes measurable time.
- **Practical rule:** Every 3 seconds of delay ≈ 1 km distance to the lightning.

**Key Concepts:** Speed of light, speed of sound, electromagnetic vs. sound waves

## Question 11: Why does food cook faster in a pressure cooker?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What limits cooking speed in an open pot?* — Water boils at 100°C (at 1 atm) and cannot get hotter while boiling.
2. *How can we raise the boiling point?* — By increasing pressure (pressure-temperature relationship).
3. *Does higher temperature speed up cooking?* — Yes, chemical reaction rates increase with temperature.

**Answer:**
A pressure cooker seals steam inside, raising internal pressure to ~2 atm. This increases water's boiling point to ~121°C.

- **Why this matters:** Cooking involves chemical reactions, which roughly double in speed for every 10°C increase. The extra 21°C speeds cooking by 50–70%.
- **Governing principle:** The Clausius-Clapeyron equation describes how boiling point rises with pressure.

**Key Concepts:** Pressure-temperature relationship, boiling point elevation, chemical reaction rates

## Question 12: Why do mosquito bites itch?

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. *What does the mosquito inject?* — Saliva containing anticoagulant proteins to keep blood flowing.
2. *How does the body react to foreign proteins?* — The immune system detects and responds to them.
3. *What causes the itch specifically?* — Histamine release activates nerve endings.

**Answer:**
The itch is your body's **immune response** to foreign proteins in mosquito saliva:

- The mosquito injects anticoagulants to prevent blood clotting. Your immune system recognizes these as foreign and releases **histamine**.
- Histamine causes blood vessels to swell (creating the red bump) and activates itch-sensing nerve endings.
- Scratching damages more cells, releasing more histamine — creating a feedback cycle. Antihistamine creams block this response.

**Key Concepts:** Immune response, histamine, anticoagulants
