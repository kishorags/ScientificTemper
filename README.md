## About Scientific Temper Competition

The Scientific Temper Competition tests the approach and reasoning ability of students regarding happenings related to normal day-to-day activities and observations of the world. It explores scientific awareness among the student community. Students are expected to answer based on scientific principles and concepts. While evaluating, emphasis is given to understanding of basic scientific principles and approach to solve the problem, rather than just the solution itself.

The competition encourages students to:

- Question everyday phenomena
- Apply scientific principles to real-world observations
- Develop logical and analytical thinking
- Show clear reasoning and approach in their answers
- Provide brief and focused solutions
- Demonstrate original ideas and creative thinking

## How to Use

1. Read through the sample questions and try to answer them yourself first
2. Compare your reasoning with the provided answers
3. Understand the key scientific concepts involved
4. Practice with additional questions provided at the end
5. Develop a habit of questioning and analyzing everyday observations
